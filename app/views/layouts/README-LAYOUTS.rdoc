= Layouts

== Templates

Treat layouts as working a bit like templates in Keynote:

* menu
* form
* list
* map
* form + list (see microposts), -- composes form & list
* form + map  -- composes form & map
* map + list  -- composes map and list
* tweet-list  -- descends from list

the composite forms should work with responsive design ideas,
put side by side or one on top of other, as indicated

== Caveats
* why is _footer inside the container in the main app layout?
* instantiate contact
